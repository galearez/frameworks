# JSX renderer

JSX is a syntax extension to the JavaScript language, provides a way to structure components rendering using a familiar syntax for all web developers.

It was developed by the React team at Meta (formerly Facebook), and its used by a few frameworks like Solid.js and the mentioned before React.js

## Description

This is my own implementation of a JSX renderer, and its based on the work of two people [Jason Miller](https://jasonformat.com/wtf-is-jsx/) and [Rodrigo Pombo](https://pomb.us/build-your-own-react/).
