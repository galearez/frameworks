# Practice projects

This directory contains the projects I've made as practice to help me understand, how the technologies we use in web development work.

Here you can find my implementations of the parts we can usually find in a framework/library, some packages, and other things.

## Projects

**All this projects are based on other peoples effort to help people like me to learn, thanks to all of them**
